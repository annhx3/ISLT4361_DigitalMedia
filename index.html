Hello, I am a senior in the BS Information Technology program at Mizzou.  I am taking this course as a technical elective.  While I have experience in some aspects of this course, others will be new to me so I am excited to expand my knowledge in this area.  I am graduating in May, getting married the next day and leaving for a month-long honeymoon a couple of days later, so it will be a busy semester between finishing strong in school and planning!  I have been working as an intern for almost 2 years at Veterans United as a Web Application Developer and it's been fantastic - I hope to stay on with them once I graduate.  If I don't stay on there, though, I hope to do some traveling and maybe get a job in another state or country.  I look forward to getting to know everyone in the discussions on here!
